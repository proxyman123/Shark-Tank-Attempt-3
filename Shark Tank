    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p1>Are you short? Our goal is to fix that. 
    </p1>

    <h2>The Product</h2>
    <p1>Our product, ShoeUp, is a shoe attatchment made to increase your height </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>through the use of pneumatic cylinders, which can hold up to 500kg, </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>meaning it can support you and your grandma.</p1>

    <div>
        <fieldset><legend><strong>Cry About Production</strong></legend>
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p1>Because it's hard to make shoe attatchments that make you tall, we're </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>going to make that easier, for both you, and us. Mainly us though. </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>We're planning on outsourcing material production and procurement to </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>countries with massive, cheap labor pools, such as China. From there, </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>we can lower the prices of our product because people don't care where </p1>
    <p1>or how a product is made, so long as it's cheap. </p1>
        </fieldset>

    <h2>Style</h2>
    <p1>Last but not least, is a common point of concern for a lot of people who </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>are too picky for their own good; style. After a few surveys and interviews </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>have returned negative feedback in terms of how stylish and good the ShoeUps will </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>look, we have decided that our attatchments will be better looking than whatever </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>the idiots at the Nike and Adidas marketing teams can come up with. Many people </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>believe that it is impossible for pneumatic cylinders to look good at the bottom </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>of shoes. However, we can assure you, that whatever it will end up looking like, </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>it'll still be better than whatever Joe Biden has goin on. </p1>
